            Please note that this assignment was merely an exercise in analyzing
            statistical <br />data for design purposes. The A/B data used in
            this assignment is fabricated.

          <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Per this project's title, I explored the intersections of design and
            statistics by conducting an A/B test on two different UI designs and
            analyzing the results. Here, I gained experience using statistical
            data to draw conclusions on whether a design choice could reasonably
            impact user interaction. <br /><br />
            A medical appointment scheduling program was used for this test.
            Version A and its corresponding data is depicted below. <br /><br />

          <p>
            As an A/B test, version B had very minimal changes. However, I
            decided to focus my revisions on the text color and button styling
            with the hope that it would allow users to book an appointment on
            the program with greater efficiency. Webpage version B is below.

              <h3>Creating Hypotheses</h3>
              <p>
                Once I completed the revisions for webpage version B, I created
                null and alternative hypotheses.
              </p>
              <h4>Misclick rate</h4>
              <p>
                Definition: the frequency with which users click something else
                on the page before finding the correct button for the task.
              </p>
              <p>
                Null hypothesis: The distribution of misclicks is the same
                between versions A and B when users attempt to identify the
                button to book an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown
                Medical Center on April 23, 2024, on webpages A and B.
                <br /><br />Alternative hypothesis: The distribution of
                misclicks on webpage b is different from those on webpage A.
                <br /><br />Reasons: The additional affordance of working button
                styling and increased button text visibility on webpage B should
                allow users to accurately identify the button to book the
                correct appointment, thereby causing the distribution of
                misclicks to differ from webpage A. <br /><br />Predictions: For
                the reasons stated above, I predict the experiment results will
                reject the null hypothesis.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="page-time">
              <h4>Time on page</h4>
              <p>Definition: time spent on the webpage for each user group.</p>
              <p>
                Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the average time
                spent on the webpage between versions A and B when attempting to
                identify the button to book an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at
                Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024.
                <br /><br />Alternative hypothesis: The average time spent on
                webpage B is lower than the time spent on webpage A.
                <br /><br />Reasons: The additional affordance of working button
                styling and increased button text visibility on webpage B should
                allow users to identify the button to book the correct
                appointment with better time efficiency than webpage A.
                <br /><br />Predictions: For the reasons stated above, I predict
                the experiment results will reject the null hypothesis.

            <div class="click-num">
              <h4>Number of clicks</h4>
              <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center">
                I have chosen the version B webpage‚Äôs number of clicks as my
                metric.
              </p>
              <p>
                Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the average number of
                clicks between versions A and B when attempting to identify the
                button to book an appointment with Adam Ng, MD at Morristown
                Medical Center on April 23, 2024.

                <br /><br />Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in the
                average number of clicks on web pages A and B.

                <br /><br />Reasons: The additional affordance of working button
                styling and increased button text visibility on webpage B should
                allow users to identify the button to book the correct
                appointment in a fewer number of clicks than on webpage A.
                <br /><br />Predictions: For the reasons stated above, I predict
                the experiment results will reject the null hypothesis.

            <h2>II. Data Collection</h2>
            <p>
              The data for this experiment was collected from participants with
              several prior experiences navigating the webpage interfaces. As
              such, the data is extremely biased. Nonetheless, the results of
              the test are provided below.

            <h2>III. Analysis</h2>
            <p>
              Afterward, I applied the appropriate statistical tests to each
              tested metric.
            </p>
            <p>
              Misclick rate: ùõò2 test I decided to apply the chi-squared test to
              analyze the misclick rate because this data is categorical,
              reflected in the form of booleans‚Äîtrue or false. The magnitude of
              the difference between the misclick rates for versions A and B is
              statistically significant which is evidenced by the ùõò2 and
              p-values. The ùõò2 value of 18.2 indicates a significantly high
              difference between the misclick rates for versions A and B.
              Additionally, the low p-value of roughly 0.0000199 reflects an
              extremely low chance that versions A and B are the same.
              Therefore, I reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative
              hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Time on page: One-tailed test I decided to apply the one-tailed
              test to analyze the time spent on the webpage because this data is
              continuous, and reflected through a range of numbers. The time
              spent on version B is statistically significantly lower than that
              spent on version A, which is evidenced by the t-score and
              p-values. The t-score value of roughly 8.329 indicates that users
              spent a significantly longer amount of time on version A than they
              did on version B. Additionally, the high p-value of roughly
              0.999999999 reflects that there is an extremely high chance that
              version A‚Äôs misclick rate is lower than that of version B.
              Therefore, I reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative
              hypothesis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Number of clicks: Two-tailed test I decided to apply the
              two-tailed test to analyze users‚Äô number of clicks on webpage
              versions A and B because this data is continuous and reflected
              through a range of numbers, and the test analyzes the difference
              between values. Users‚Äô number of clicks on version B is
              statistically significantly lower than that of version A, which is
              evidenced by the t-score and p-values. The t-score value of -3.68
              is negative which indicates that the number of clicks on version B
              is significantly lower than that of version A. Additionally, the
              p-value of roughly 0.0012 is below the commonly used significance
              level of 0.05. This data suggests a difference between the number
              of clicks on versions A and B. Therefore, I reject the null
              hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.

          <h2>IV. Summary Statistics</h2>
          <p>
            In the conducted A/B test, data was collected from two web pages
            labeled A and B. Webpage A recorded a total of 24 data points, while
            webpage B recorded 28. This difference in counts led to a higher
            weight for the trials in version B compared to version A. The
            calculated degrees of freedom (df) for versions A and B were 1.
            Moreover, the mean amount of time spent on version A was 36139.46,
            significantly higher than version B‚Äôs mean of 9607.46. Additionally,
            the median time spent on version A was 36748.5 while version B‚Äôs
            median was 8362. The mean number of clicks on version A was 8.34,
            with a median of 5, while version B had a mean of 1.01 with a median
            of 3 clicks. <br /><br />This data suggests a notable disparity
            between the ease with which users could book an appointment with
            Adam Ng, MD at Morristown Medical Center on April 23, 2024. Based on
            these statistics, we can assume that the design differences between
            versions A and B were statistically significant, providing
            sufficient evidence to assert that the additional webpage styling
            and text visibility on webpage B contributed to greater accuracy in
            booking appointments.
